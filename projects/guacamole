        <h1 class="hero-text">Why Guacamole?</h1>
        <p class="explainer">
        When comparing Guacamole to other Remote Desktop Software, it is always important to keep the Browser limitations in Mind.
        For example, you can't use the Windows key in any meaningfull way, this is because Windows doesn't allow you to capture it fully.
        Nevertheless, Guacamole is a capable Remote Desktop Client / Server, it is performat and it is easy to manage multiple Connections.
